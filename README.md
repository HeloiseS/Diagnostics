# Diagnostics

This repository contains code and data used in Dorn-Wallenstein & Levesque (2018), and is currently being used to develop a follow-up paper.
The code used in our analysis is contained in [code/], namely [`diagnostics.py`](./code/diagnostics.py).
[paper_2018/diagnostics.ipynb](./paper_2018/diagnostics.ipynb) is an example notebook that imports functions from [`diagnostics.py`](./code/diagnostics.py), and shows some examples of how to use them. It can be used to completely reproduce the results in Dorn-Wallenstein & Levesque (2018).

Please email tzdw@uw.edu if you have any questions!
